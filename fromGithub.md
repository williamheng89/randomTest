this is a file I am adding from github


We use git pull to grab edits from the remote repo onto our local system.
After I edit this, I will do git status and see that there have been changes mad.
I will thin use git add to stage the commit, then use git commit to make a commit.
Lastly, I will use git push to send out the commit.
